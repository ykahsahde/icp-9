        <p>Bagheera appears in the 1967 animated adaptation by Walt Disney Productions. His voice is provided by Sebastian Cabot. Early in the film's development, Bill Peet suggested Howard Morris as the voice of Bagheera, but Disney did not approve of the choice,[2] with Reitherman and other animators preferring either Karl Swenson or Sebastian Cabot.[3] Cabot was the final choice.[4]</p>
